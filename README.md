Features:
Add Tasks: Users can add new tasks to the list.
Mark as Completed: Tasks can be marked as completed, and the UI reflects the status.
Delete Tasks: Users can delete tasks from the list.
Local Storage: The app stores tasks locally, so the list persists across page reloads.

CSS: Adds basic styling and responsiveness.
JavaScript: Handles task management, event handling, and local storage.
